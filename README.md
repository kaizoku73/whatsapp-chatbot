WhatsApp Webhook Integration with OpenAI Assistant:

This project demonstrates how to integrate a WhatsApp webhook with an AI-powered assistant, using FastAPI for server-side logic and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for generating conversational replies. The system listens to incoming WhatsApp messages, verifies the webhook, and responds with AI-generated content.

Key Features:
1. Webhook Integration: Handles incoming messages from WhatsApp and responds via the Graph API.
2. AI-powered Response: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate text-based responses to user queries.
3. Webhook Verification: Implements secure webhook verification using the provided token.
4. FastAPI: Utilizes FastAPI to handle HTTP requests, both for the incoming webhook and the verification process.
5. Ngrok for Local Development: The server is exposed to the internet via ngrok for easy testing and verification of webhooks locally.

Technologies:
1. FastAPI: Web framework for building APIs quickly and with async support.
2. OpenAI GPT-3.5: Used for generating natural language responses.
3. httpx: An async HTTP client used for sending responses to WhatsApp via Facebookâ€™s Graph API.
4. Ngrok: Tunnel your local server for testing WhatsApp webhook with a public URL.

Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your .env file with the necessary credentials (VERIFY_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN, VERSION, PORT, and OPENAI_API_KEY).

Use ngrok to expose the server to the internet and verify the webhook via the GET /webhook endpoint.
The assistant will generate replies based on user input via WhatsApp.

Notes:
Ensure that your webhook is correctly set up with WhatsApp for the POST /webhook route to function properly.
The assistant is designed to respond in a casual, human-like manner, with a 20-word limit unless otherwise specified. You can change the instructions based on your need.
